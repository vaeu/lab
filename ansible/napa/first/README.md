# first-role

This is the first Ansible role that requires one to install `nginx`
binary via HTTP from [some remote
server](https://example.com/registry/nginx_1.0.0), place said binary
into `/bin/` and add it as a `systemd` system service.

## Measures Iâ€™ve undertaken to complete this task (all in present tense)

1. Create both the controller and the target Ansible VMs just for fun.
1. Manipulate both machines easily with the help of an alias:

```sh
cat >> ~/.ssh/config <<EOF

Host controller
  Hostname 192.168.1.32
  User c

Host target
  Hostname 192.168.1.242
  User t

EOF
```
