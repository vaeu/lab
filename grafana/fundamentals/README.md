## GETTING OUR FEET WET

Folks at ‘Grafana’ have a rather ample list of
[tutorials](https://grafana.com/tutorials/) suited for both complete
beginners and avid tinkerers alike. I’ll go ahead and document my
journey of playing around with ‘Grafana’ using [this
tutorial](https://grafana.com/tutorials/grafana-fundamentals/) for
reference. Without further ado, off we go!

‘Grafana’ provides us with a repository that contains source code for a
sample application as well as `docker-compose.yml` file that wraps
things up; let’s clone the repo and start the app:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/grafana/tutorial-environment.git
